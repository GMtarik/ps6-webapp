# ps6-webapp
This code provides a Shiny app that displays monthly temperature readings from satellite observations of the lower troposphere from January 1979 to December 2020. The data was collected by the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) and is provided by Remote Sensing Systems (RSS).

The app has three tabs:

Information: This page provides general information about the dataset.

Plot: This page allows the user to select a year and one or more months, and then displays a plot of the total temperature change by month for the selected year and months. The user can also select the point color and size. The text output below the plot displays the number of observations in the selected subset.

Table: This page allows the user to select a month, and then displays a table of the region and temperature for that month. The text output below the table displays the number of observations in the selected subset.
